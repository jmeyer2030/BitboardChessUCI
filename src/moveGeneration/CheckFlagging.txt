Flagging moves as checks:
Checks are either caused by the attacks of the piece being moved or are a discovered attack

We can pretty easily check if the piece attacks the enemy king by checking
    if a piece of the moved piece's type can attack the location of the enemy king

For discoveries, we should know that moving a certain piece out of the in-between squares will result in a check.


For Castling, there is no risk of discovery (since the king and rook cannot possibly be blockers) but we need to check the moved rook

For En Passant, we need to check if the pawn  being captured was pinned, and if capturing pawn causes a discovery

A piece is a potentialChecker iff:
  - it is on the same side as the active player
  - it blocks a check from an active players slider to the enemy king

Then, if a potentialChecker moves to a square that is not inbetween the slider and the enemy king, then there is a discovered check


To Compute potentialCheckers:



We probably want to keep track of:
- pieces that if moved could cause a discovered check on the enemy
    Discovery rays from the enemy king
- pieces that if moved could cause a discovered check on ourselves
    Discovery rays from our own king

For both we should know: the location of the slider that causes this situation

To do this we have two int arrays that store integers that are pieces that if moved cause a self check or a discoverd check


How should position/move generator store checks:
 - Move generator should compute if a move is a check by:
    - Checking discoveries
    - Checking EP
    - Checking castle
 - Should move generator pass information about the check to the position?

 - Position should CERTAINLY store if active player is in check/double check, and where the checkers are.
     because this can be used to see if a move is legal much more quickly
 - Moves should certainly store if they are a check because this can be used in move ordering
 - Position on make move should compute check information. Move gneerator should compute only if the move is a check.
