moveGeneration Package Description:
This package includes all things related to generating moves and attacks. 

PieceLogic classes use pre-initialized bitboards that store information about attacks and moves so that they are able to quickly retrieve this information.
For sliding pieces, the number of possible moveBoards that we would want to return is generally quite high, so it is important to be able to retrieve them
quickly using some sort of hashing. To do this, we use the established technique of "Magic Bitboards" to generate a surjective function from a blockerboard,
a board that represents the presence or absence of pieces within the confines of a piece's movement behavior, to a moveBoard. Read more about it at the following

The interface, LogicInterface defines the ways that these Logic classes can be interacted with to return attack and move information.

In the case of the pawn, it is more useful for move generation to get specific types of moves rather than arbitrary moves, so we make use of that
