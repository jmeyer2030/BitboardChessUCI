## Todo:

### Priority:

how should checks be handled. Moves and positions should certainly have checks.
we check if a move is a check when we check if it puts our own king in check and update it as such.
if it is a check, when we apply it, we update position's check status.

Solution: during generation of strictly legal, check if a move is a check or not


- add check to position (look for both enemy and us check)
  - will allow castle rejection
  - will allow move rejection (if self in check)
  - allows check label to moves
- Add flipboard option
- Add promotion piece type
- Look for checks in move generation
- Add game ending

## Static Evaluation

How do we consider piece activity/development in evaluation?

IDEA: Since we need to compute all legal moves for check validation, can we use the number of legal moves as a metric?

IDEA: Create better opening/middle/endgame detection and clearer piece square tables.
 
### Looking forward:

- Add negamax
- Add quiescence
- Fix whatever make/unmake bug
- 

## Overview:

This engine primarily uses bitboards, representations of a board as a 64bit long 
to indicate the presence or absence of something on a board.

This engine uses Little-Endian Rank-File board representation, with the least
significant bit being zero.

### Implementation:

For our purposes we represent positions with these fields:

#### Piece Locations:

- long occupancy: BB of occupied squares
- long whitePieces: BB of white pieces
- long blackPieces: BB of black pieces
- long pawns: BB of pawns
- long rooks: BB of rooks
- long knights: BB of knights
- long bishops: BB of bishops
- long queens: BB of queens
- long kings: BB of kings

#### State

- boolean whiteToPlay: if white to move
- byte castleRights: 0b000(WQ)(WK)(BQ)(BK)
- int enPassant: location of pawn if it advanced one square (else 0)
- int gameStatus: -1 Black win, 0 stalemate, 1 white win, 2 ongoing
- int rule50: Moves since last pawn move/capture
- int fullMoveCount: Total number of moves
 
#### Attack Maps:

- whiteAttackMap: BB of squares white attacks
- blackAttackMap: BB of squares black attacks

## Move Generation:

### Overview:

Moves are generated in a pseudo-legal fashion meaning that checks aren't evaluated during move generation.
Instead, checks are detected by applying them to a board and looking for self-checks.

### Moves:

Moves are not stored in the position, and must contain enough information to be reversible.
Thus, they have the following fields:

#### Move details:

- start: square a piece started on
- destination: square that the piece is moving to
- MoveType: QUIET, CAPTURE, ENPASSANT, PROMOTION, CAPMOTION, CASTLE
- promotionType: Piece type that a pawn promoted to, else null
- captureType: Piece type that was captured
 
#### Position details:

- halfMoveCount: halfMoveCount of position before this move is applied
- castleRights: castleRights before this move is applied

## GUI:

The GUI seeks to provide options for starting a game against one's self
primarily for testing reasons.

Additionally one should be able to play against the engine in a variety of time
controls.

### Starting Options:

First the option is given to play against the engine or yourself.

In the case that the human is selected the game start
